# ticTacToe

This is a simple "Tic Tac Toe" application that I developed to learn React. I decided to create this app as a hands-on project to immerse myself in the world of React and better understand how this popular framework works.

By building this application, I was able to directly experiment with fundamental React concepts such as:
* components
* state
* event handling
